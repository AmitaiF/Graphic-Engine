# Graphic-Engine
A Graphic Engine made for a "Mini project in Software Engineering" course.

This program renders a virtual 3-dimensional graphical scene, with all the physics involved (light source, rays, reflections, refractions, color, occlusions, etc.).

It was developed using agile methodology, and by implementing TDD principles.
